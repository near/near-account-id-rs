## 1.0.0 - 2023-12-22

This is the first stable release of near-account-id crate!

`AccountId` and `AccountIdRef` are two main types of this crate that have same relation as `String` and `str` in standard library of Rust.

AccountId guarantees to hold a valid NEAR account id (unless users explicitly opt-in for the unvalidated constructors feature and break this promise).

See all the changes listed in alpha releases below to learn about `AccountIdRef` and various new helper methods.
